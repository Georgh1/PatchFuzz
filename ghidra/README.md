It is worth noticing that while the best building environment for this tool is ubuntu 16.04,however,in order to make cfgs,we need a `python >=3.8` environment to install `pyhidra`.
You may consider using `update-alternatives` command to ensure that multiple different versions of python could coexist with each other.
After you downloaded/compiled your ghidra,follow the steps recommended by pyhidra authors to install pyhidra!
This script is temporily for i386 only ,it require further developments to target more architecture
